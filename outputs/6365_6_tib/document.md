## 11.1   INTRODUCTION

This section  contains  data  referenced  from  other  sections  of  this  book.  Figures  are  presented  in  order  by section. Figure 2-1 supports the simplified theory of operation in section 2; figure 2-3 supports performance monitoring and fault detection isolation/testing in sections 2 and 7; figure 7-1 supports the detailed theory of operation  in  section  2  and  corrective  maintenance  in  section  7.  The  remaining  figure  7-18,  Transmitter Wiring Diagram, supports corrective maintenance in section 7.
